I joined the University of Leeds as [University Academic Fellow (Assistant Professor for US folks)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSEdmFuN_tQ) under the [250 Great Mind Initiative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TJiem6UTuY). My research interests are in the area of Communication and Networking for IoT, Robotics and Autonomous Systems. Previously I worked on the US Army Research Lab [(ARL)](https://www.arl.army.mil/) funded project : `Cognitive Green Wireless Communication- A Network Science Perspective'. I received my B.Eng degree in information and communication system engineering from the School of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, NUST, Pakistan in 2008. I was awarded the NUST's most prestigious Rector's gold medal for my final year project on Analysis of Forward Error Correction Schemes over Wireless Channels with Memory under supervision of Dr [Syed Ali Khayam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alikhayam/).

From September 2007 till August 2008, I served as a Research Assistant in Wireless Sensor Network Lab on a collaborative research project between NUST, Pakistan and Ajou University, South Korea. In 2008, I was awarded overseas research student (ORS) scholarship along with Tetley Lupton and Excellence Scholarships to pursue my PhD at the School of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, U.K. I was also awarded with COST IC0902, DAAD and Royal Academy of Engineering grants to promote my research.

I was a visiting research scientist at Qatar Innovations and Mobility Center from October to December 2013. I have served as an invited reviewer for IEEE flagship journals and conferences. Over past few years, I have served as TPC Member for IEEE WCNC, IEEE VTC, IEEE Globecom, IEEE ICC. My research is focused towards design  analysis and implementation of the large scale ad-hoc wireless networks by employing tools from stochastic geometry and random graph theory. I am also an embedded systems and programming enthusiast with several international certifications from Microsoft, IBM and Sun Microsystems.
